# Data transformations with Java

This is a collection of jobs that are supposed to transform data. These jobs are using _Spark_ to process larger volumes
of data and are supposed to run on a _Spark_ cluster (via `spark-submit`).

## Pre-requisites

We use [`batect`](https://batect.dev/) to dockerise the tasks in this exercise.
`batect` is a lightweight wrapper around Docker that helps to ensure tasks run consistently (across linux, mac windows).
With `batect`, the only dependencies that need to be installed are Docker and Java >=8. Every other dependency is
managed inside Docker containers. If docker desktop can't be installed then Colima could be used on Mac and Linux.

> **For Windows, docker desktop is the only option for using container to run application otherwise local laptop should be set up.**

Please make sure you have the following installed and can run them

* Docker Desktop or Colima
* Java (11)

You could use following instructions as guidelines to install Docker or Colima and Java.

```bash
# Install pre-requisites needed by batect 
# For mac users: 
./go.sh install-with-docker-desktop
OR
./go.sh install-with-colima

# For windows/linux users:
# Please ensure Docker and java >=8 is installed 
scripts\install_choco.ps1
scripts\install.bat

# For local laptop setup ensure that Java 11 with Spark 3.2.1 is available. More details in README-LOCAL.md
```

> **If you are using Colima, please ensure that you start Colima. For staring Colima, you could use following command:**

`./go.sh start-colima`

## List of commands

General pattern apart from installation and starting of Colima is:

`./go.sh run-<type>-<action>`

type could be local, colima or docker-desktop

action could be unit-test, integration-test or job.

Full list of commands for Mac and Linux users is as follows:

| S.No.      | Command | Action     |

## Jobs

There are two applications in this repo: Word Count, and Citibike.

Currently these exist as skeletons, and have some initial test cases which are defined but ignored. For each
application, please un-ignore the tests and implement the missing logic.

## Wordcount

A NLP model is dependent on a specific input file. This job is supposed to preprocess a given text file to produce this
input file for the NLP model (feature engineering). This job will count the occurrences of a word within the given text
file (corpus).

There is a dump of the data lake for this under `test/resources/data/words.txt` with a text file.

#### Input

Simple `*.txt` file containing text.

#### Output

A single `*.csv` file containing data similar to:

```csv
"word","count"
"a","3"
"an","5"
...
```

#### Run the job using Docker Desktop on Mac or Linux

```bash
JOB=wordcount ./go.sh run-docker-desktop-job 
```

#### Run the job using Docker Desktop on Windows

```bash
$env:JOB = wordcount 
.\go.ps1 run-docker-desktop-job 
```

#### Run the job using Colima

```bash
JOB=wordcount ./go.sh run-colima-job 
```

### Citibike

For analytics purposes the BI department of a bike share company would like to present dashboards, displaying the
distance each bike was driven. There is a `*.csv` file that contains historical data of previous bike rides. This input
file needs to be processed in multiple steps. There is a pipeline running these jobs.

![citibike pipeline](docs/citibike.png)

There is a dump of the datalake for this under `test/resources/data/citibike.csv` with historical data.

#### Ingest

Reads a `*.csv` file and transforms it to parquet format. The column names will be sanitized (whitespaces replaced).

##### Input

Historical bike ride `*.csv` file:

```csv
"tripduration","starttime","stoptime","start station id","start station name","start station latitude",...
364,"2017-07-01 00:00:00","2017-07-01 00:06:05",539,"Metropolitan Ave & Bedford Ave",40.71534825,...
...
```

##### Output

`*.parquet` files containing the same content

```csv
"tripduration","starttime","stoptime","start_station_id","start_station_name","start_station_latitude",...
364,"2017-07-01 00:00:00","2017-07-01 00:06:05",539,"Metropolitan Ave & Bedford Ave",40.71534825,...
...
```

##### Run the job using Docker Desktop on Mac or Linux

```bash
JOB=citibike_ingest ./go.sh run-docker-desktop-job
```

##### Run the job using Docker Desktop on Windows

```bash
$env:JOB = "citibike_ingest"
.\go.ps1 run-docker-desktop-job
```

##### Run the job using Colima

```bash
JOB=citibike_ingest ./go.sh run-colima-job
```

#### Distance calculation

This job takes bike trip information and calculates the "as the crow flies" distance traveled for each trip. It reads
the previously ingested data parquet files.

Hint:

- For distance calculation, consider using [**Harvesine formula**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) as
  an option.

##### Input

Historical bike ride `*.parquet` files

```csv
"tripduration",...
364,...
...
```

##### Outputs

`*.parquet` files containing historical data with distance column containing the calculated distance.

```csv
"tripduration",...,"distance"
364,...,1.34
...
```

##### Run the job

##### Run the job using Docker Desktop on Mac or Linux

```bash
JOB=citibike_distance_calculation ./go.sh run-docker-desktop-job
```

##### Run the job using Docker Desktop on Windows

```bash
$env:JOB = citibike_distance_calculation 
.\go.ps1 run-docker-desktop-job
```

##### Run the job using Colima

```bash
JOB=citibike_distance_calculation ./go.sh run-colima-job
```

## Running the code outside container

If you would like to run the code in your laptop locally without containers then please follow
instructions [here](README-LOCAL.md).
